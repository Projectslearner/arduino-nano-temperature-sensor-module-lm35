# Arduino Nano LM35 Temperature Sensor

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to use an LM35 temperature sensor with an Arduino Nano to measure ambient temperature in Celsius. The LM35 is a precision integrated-circuit temperature sensor that provides an analog voltage output proportional to the Celsius temperature.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Nano**
- **LM35 Temperature Sensor**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect LM35 Temperature Sensor to Arduino Nano:**
   - **VCC Pin:** Connect to 5V on Arduino Nano.
   - **Output Pin:** Connect to analog pin A0 on Arduino Nano.
   - **GND Pin:** Connect to GND on Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the LM35 temperature sensor to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.
   - Open the serial monitor with a baud rate of 9600.
   - Observe the serial monitor output displaying the current temperature in Celsius.

#### Applications

- **Environmental Monitoring:** Use for monitoring ambient temperature in various applications.
- **Temperature Control:** Implement in projects requiring temperature-based control or feedback.
- **Data Logging:** Useful for recording temperature data over time for analysis or reporting.

#### Notes

- Ensure the LM35 temperature sensor is correctly connected to the Arduino Nano and powered.
- Calibrate the sensor if necessary for accurate temperature readings.
- Adjust the delay in the code (`delay(1000)`) to change the interval between temperature readings.
